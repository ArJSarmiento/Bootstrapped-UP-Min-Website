                    <p>
                        Republic Act 7889, An Act Creating the University of the Philippines in Mindanao, was
                        signed into law by President Fidel V. Ramos on February 20, 1995. But the vision of
                        having a UP in Mindanao however started way before that.<br /><br />The UP Alumni
                        Association-Davao Chapter, which was established on December 3, 1949, had wanted for
                        more than two decades for the establishment of a UP in Mindanao. As early as 1961, the
                        UP Summer School already
                        offered extension courses in Law, Business Administration and Education, with the old
                        location of the Davao Central Elementary School as venue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On November 24 and 25, 1989, the UPAA Davao Chapter hosted the 12th UP Alumni Institute
                        with Senator Vicente Paterno as keynote speaker. UP President Jose Abueva, who attended
                        the conference, was confronted with the strong and united voice of about 630
                        alumni in attendance as well as the media and the business sector, all clamoring for a
                        resolution that would promote the establishment of a UP in Mindanao in Davao City. The
                        resolution was unanimously approved and adopted
                        by the Institute on November 25, 1989. This was submitted to the UPAA National and
                        endorsed to the Board of Regents.<br /><br />The vision of UP in Mindanao began to
                        materialize when,
                        on the third regular session of the House of Representatives on April 30, 1990, 1st
                        District Representative Prospero C. Nograles introduced House Bill No. 30358, also known
                        as an “Act to establish the University of
                        the Philippines in Mindanao.”<br /><br />A public hearing on HB No. 30358 was conducted
                        by Senator Edgardo Angara (then Chairman of the Senate Committee on Education) on
                        October 12, 1990 at the Davao Chamber of Commerce,
                        Kalakalan Hall. It was sponsored by Representative Nograles and Rodolfo del Rosario of
                        Davao del Norte. A strong sentiment for the establishment of a UP in Mindanao pervaded
                        the public hearing. To alleviate the strong
                        clamor for a UP in Mindanao, Abueva created instead the UP Consortium System, much like
                        the Open University. <br /><br />When Abueva’s term ended, President Fidel V. Ramos
                        appointed Emil Q. Javier as UP President. President
                        Ramos had previously instructed President Javier to create a fact-finding committee
                        composed of Regents Oscar Alfonso, Vice-President for Planning Fortunato dela Peña,
                        Atty. Carmelita Yadao-Guno and Prof. Rogelio Cuyno.
                        The committee came to Davao for an ocular inspection of University of Southern
                        Philippines (USP) in Bago Oshiro.
                        <br /><br />After receiving the committee report, Javier did not pursue the plan to
                        convert USP to UP in Mindanao due to the resistance demonstrated by the USP faculty and
                        staff. Instead, he opted for congressional
                        action. At the same time, the committee also talked with the National Bureau of Plant
                        and Industry director Nerios Roperos for the segregation of 204 hectares of the BPI area
                        in Bago Oshiro for the UP in Mindanao campus.
                        The task of pursuing the House Bill for UP in Mindanao in Congress was given to Davao
                        City 3rd District Congressman Elias B. Lopez, as he was the only UP alumnus among the
                        Davao representatives.<br /><br />Republic
                        Act 7889, the bill creating UP in Mindanao was finally enacted into law on February 20,
                        1995. On March 22 of the same year, the Board of Regents passed a resolution officially
                        creating the University of the Philippines
                        in Mindanao. To emphasize the importance of RA 7889 to the Mindanaoans, a reenactment of
                        the signing was held at the Central Bank, Davao City with President Fidel V. Ramos
                        himself in attendance.<br /><br />The Lee Business
                        Center in J. Luna corner J. dela Cruz Streets and the Casa Mercado Building in Matina
                        served as UP in Mindanao’s home from March to September 1995, and from September to
                        January 1996, respectively.<br /><br />On June
                        1996, the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Management were created. After
                        a year, the CAS was split into the College of Humanities and Social Sciences and the
                        College of Science and Mathematics. The School
                        of Management was retained.<br /><br />On February 20, the Oblation was installed in
                        Bago Oshiro during the University’s 3rd Foundation Anniversary. The Board of Regents
                        granted full autonomy to UP in Mindanao, on February
                        26, 1998, making it the sixth constituent unit of the UP System. Dean Rogelio V. Cuyno,
                        was elevated and installed as its 1st Chancellor on December 11, of the same year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 2nd Chancellor was Ricardo de Ungria, the 3rd Chancellor was Gilda C. Rivero, and
                        the 4th Chancellor is Sylvia B. Concepcion. The 5th Chancellor is Larry N. Digal (term:
                        March 2019-February 2021).
